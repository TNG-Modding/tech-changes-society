 tech_galactic_bureaucracy_triggers_diaspora_events.1.desc:0 "With the advent of §Y$tech_galactic_bureaucracy$§!, many within the §H[Root.GetName]§! are deciding to migrate across our empire. To see, to go, to conquer as the §HImperialists§! adage goes. With plasma rifle in hand and fleet at the back, are people are poised to emmigrate across the empire with newly ratified, galactic holowork. Those inclined towards §Hxenophobia§! urge us to stipulate new clauses in our holowork guidelines that encourage colonial profits to flow back into the core worlds. If these militarized settlers are allowed to emmigrate and set up petty states of their own within our borders, they may go out of reach of our core world bureaucracy."

Settlements within our borders that §B[Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle] [Root.Owner.GetRulerName]§! has never even heard of have grown in independence and strength. The natural buildup of colonial munitions signifies the greater militarization of our newly emmigrated subjects. It will be incredibly difficult to bring the colonial diaspora back in line with core world interests."

We can truly say that the §YDiaspora Crisis§! as a national phenomena is at an end."
