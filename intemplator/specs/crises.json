Many are scrambling to find out if they are among the psyionic elite. §HTraditionalists§! encourage it's use, while those inclined towards §Hauthoritarianism§! are calling for us to clamp down on usage.

This will greatly reduce our ability to acquire and hold stores of §YZro§!. What's more, citizens addicted to the substance are forming secretive cults centered around §YZro§! use. We've already apprehended a few cultists, but the greater part of our work remains undone.",
